> There are no dependencies. Online is not required.

Just run it and select the appropriate item:

1. Group Policies

> Legally. Documented. Incomplete.
>
> Only known group policies are applied through the registry.
>
> Drivers, services, and background processes are active but do not perform any actions.

2. Policies + Registry Settings

> Semi-legally. Almost complete.
>
> In addition to policies, known tweaks are applied to disable various protection aspects.
>
> Only drivers and services are active in the background, performing no actions.

3. Policies + Settings + Disabling Services and drivers

> Illegally. Complete.
>
> Also disables the startup of all related services and drivers.
>
> No background activities.

4. Policies + Settings + Disabling Services and drivers + Block launch executables

> Hacker-style. Excessive.
>
> Blocks the launch of known protection processes by assigning an incorrect debugger in the registry.
>
> Helps reduce the risk of enabling the defender after Windows update.

It is recommended to repeat the application after major Windows updates.
